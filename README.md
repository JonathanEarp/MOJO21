# MOJO21
MOJO21 is a python app used to make cataloguing MARC 21 records easier. It works similarly to an 
online citation app in that it does the formatting and the user enters in the specific information.

For more information on the Marc21 cataloguing format refer to: 
https://www.loc.gov/marc/bibliographic/bdsummary.html

Basic knowledge of the ## indicators are important for cataloguing with this program. Default values are supplied, but they may only be place-holders if your specific item requires different information. The values of the indicators are supplied for the user to edit into their entry.
